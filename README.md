This section outlines the concept of variable scope in Python and how it influences the visibility and accessibility of variables within different parts of a program.
Global Scope: Variables defined at the top level of a script or module and are accessible throughout the entire program.
Local Scope: Variables defined within a function and are only accessible within that function.
